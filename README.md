# TimesheetERP
TimesheetERP is an open source ERP created primarily for developers. Besides being made for a need, it is a project made mostly for fun. But feel free to use it.  
The primary goal was to be able to use this ERP via the CLI to not lose productivity by switching tool too often.

At the moment it includes the possibility to create timers to identify what time is spent on each task and to assign times to different projects.
